# This config is largely based on [kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) plus some additional custom plugins I've added

- [-] Am meaning to test the config on laptop to see if it is portable

Requires:

- rustup + cargo

- python

- lua

- some c compiler

- probably other stuff as well
